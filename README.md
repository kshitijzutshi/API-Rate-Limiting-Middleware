# 🚀 API Testing Project 🚀

This project contains several directories, each with a specific purpose. Here's a summary of what each directory contains:

## 📁 MiddlewareApi

This directory contains the `RateLimitMiddleware` class, which is used to limit the rate at which clients can make requests to our API.

## 📁 validators

This directory contains the `UserValidator` class, which is used to validate user data before it's processed by our API.

## 📁 config

This directory contains configuration values for our application, such as the rate limit and rate limit window for our `RateLimitMiddleware`.

## 📁 model

This directory contains the `User` class, which represents a user in our system.

## 📂 app.py

This is the main file of our application. It sets up our Flask application and routes, and applies our `RateLimitMiddleware`.

## 🎯 Concepts Explained

- **Middleware**: Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. In this project, we use middleware to limit the rate at which clients can make requests to our API.
- **Rate Limiting**: This is a technique for limiting network traffic. It sets a limit on how many requests a client can make to the API within a certain time period.
- **Data Validation**: This is the process of ensuring that data is clean, correct, and useful. In this project, we validate user data before it's processed by our API.

We hope you find this project useful and learn a lot from it! 😄
